<blockquote>
<p>One surprising thing about Ive’s approach is that conversation, rather than sketches, is how he often begins a project. Thinking—and then speaking about that thinking—is the raw material he works with. “Language is so powerful,” Ive says. “If [I say] I’m going to design a chair, think how dangerous that is. Because you’ve just said chair, you’ve just said no to a thousand ideas.
“This is where it gets exciting,” he says. “You have an idea—which is unproven and isn’t resolved, since a resolved idea is a product—and the only tangible thing about the idea are the problems. When someone says it’s not possible, and all you are being shown is why it’s not possible, you have to think and behave in a different way. [You have to say], from a place of courage, I believe it is possible.</p>

			 <p>Twitter is a product I once loved deeply. It feels silly to say that about a web app, but it is unabashedly true. I have had a relationship with Twitter since I first signed up on March 9, 2007, and over the past 15 years, Twitter has profoundly impacted my life for the better.</p>
<p>My experience of Twitter is different than many. When I signed up in 2007, it was very much people sharing what they were doing, and it later evolved into sharing what they were thinking and so much more. In a very positive way, Twitter exposed me to ideas and people far beyond what I would have encountered in my sheltered life. I found great comfort in knowing I was not the only one curious about so many things.</p>
<p>At every stage of my life, I found people sharing their thoughts in ways that helped me navigate forward. Even today, with so many people focused on shallow self-promotion, one-sided politics, or trolling others, I still find brilliant and inspiring people sharing their world (though far fewer).</p>
<p>This is how I am choosing the remember Twitter: a portal into a world of brilliant people being awesome. A portal into a community that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Built a device to tweet when your houseplant needed water (2008);</li>
<li>Turned SXSW 2008 into a location-based social network game (2008);</li>
<li>Got as excited as I did about banking regulations or financial modeling standards (2010);</li>
<li>Had parties to celebrate awarding grants to people for literally pursuing awesome ideas (2011);</li>
<li>Spent weeks discussing if a dress was blue, then sharing the physics and biology behind why people saw it differently (2015).</li>
</ul>
<p>These memories do not reflect what Twitter is today, nor something it can ever be again; truthfully, that hurts. Every horror story that leaks out what is going on inside Twitter hurts, like watching someone you care about slowly destroy their life with an addiction.</p>
<p>I finally accept that Twitter will not get better, and remaining here doesn&rsquo;t help anyone. So, I&rsquo;m letting go. After 5,716 days of almost continuous usage, I won&rsquo;t be logging on anymore. No more app or site visits and I&rsquo;m also bouncing emails from Twitter, so updates won&rsquo;t even tempt me.</p>
<p>Nothing can replace what Twitter was, but I&rsquo;m now exploring networking via the <a href="https://micro.blog/wtd">indieweb</a> and <a href="https://indieweb.social/@willd">Mastadon</a>. You can also <a href="mailto:blog@willdearman.com">email me</a>. Maybe I will talk with more people in my local community. Whatever comes next, it&rsquo;s a brave new world. Let&rsquo;s go forth and be awesome.</p>

			 <p>I love the colors of fall. While they mean a slide toward winter, the colors feel so alive and full of energy. Truth be told, when I was younger I very much hoped to live somewhere with changing seasons. It is one of the many things that, in reality, ends up being even better than you hoped.</p>
